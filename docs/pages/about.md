# **About Me**

Hi I am Jordi :wave:,<br>
I am working on getting better at CTFs, software engineering, and coding in general.<br>
I tend of focus on pwnable challenges, and I try to expose myself to a various types of challenges (machine learning, userspace, kernel, browser, smart contract)
so that I can decide which area of pwn I can specialize on.<br>
I am also interested in quantitative finance and machine learning:smile:.<br>
Thank you for your interest.
