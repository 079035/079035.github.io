description:  "Here, we evaluate the performance of quantum natural language processing models based on these ansätze at different levels in text classification tasks. We perform a comparative study and optimize the QNLP models by fine-tuning several critical hyperparameters. Our results demonstrate how the balance between simplification and expressivity affects model performance."
