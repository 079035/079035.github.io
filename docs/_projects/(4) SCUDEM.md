![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/079035/079035.github.io/master/docs/_projects/scudem-2-1.png)

Summary of Problem:
- Study done on the tendency to punish antisocial behavior
- Researchers found that infants have the innate capacity to “punish” 
- Infants will punish those who they believe are hurting others
- Based on this we will assume that is a human trait
- What does this natural tendency imply about society?
- What does this say about the long-term dynamics of different populations?
